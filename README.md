**MVVM + RxSwift Demo**

This is a small demo of MVVM & RxSwift usage.



Here's a link to a JSON document containing information about the state capital cities in the US: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/us-state-capitals.json

The task is to use an MVVM+Reactive approach to fetch this data, parse the State and City names, and display them in a table view. 

It doesn't have to be a fancy-looking table view, it's good enough if it just shows the names using two simple labels. The table can be the first screen you land on when starting the app, it just needs to perform the network call and display the data.
